# Contribute to the Cheese Shop

Welcome to Cheese Shop, a game that arose out of a deep well of Pythonesque desire. Our ultimate goal is to bring good cheese and good humor to the world with an online version of the cheesy command-line implementation.

At this point, we're practically just curds, meaning we haven't had a chance to age and are still figuring out how to get things in proper order. Eventually we'll have better contribution guidance, a la [this advice](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/) from Mozilla.

For now, as we search for the rennet that'll bring this project to maturity, let's just try to communicate well and be kind.

More to come ....
